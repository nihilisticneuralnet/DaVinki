# DaVinki - Photomosaic Generator using CIFAR-10 Dataset

A sophisticated photomosaic generator that transforms target images into artistic mosaics using images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The system employs advanced computer vision techniques, spatial-aware algorithms, and multi-dimensional feature extraction to create visually compelling mosaics while ensuring each source image is used only once.

## Project Overview

DaVinki creates photomosaics by breaking down a target image into tiles and replacing each tile with the most similar image from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The algorithm uses a unique spatial-aware assignment approach that considers both feature similarity and spatial relationships between neighboring tiles to produce coherent and aesthetically pleasing results.

## Key Features

### Advanced Feature Extraction
- **Multi-channel Color Statistics**: RGB and HSV color space analysis with percentile-based distributions
- **Texture Analysis**: Gradient-based texture features using Sobel operators
- **Frequency Domain Features**: FFT-based low and high frequency component analysis
- **Edge Detection**: Canny edge detection for shape and contour analysis
- **Local Binary Patterns**: Texture characterization using rotation-invariant LBP
- **Feature Normalization**: StandardScaler preprocessing for optimal matching

### Spatial-Aware Assignment Algorithm
- **Unique Image Constraint**: Each CIFAR-10 image used exactly once across the entire mosaic
- **Spiral Processing**: Center-out tile processing for optimal spatial coherence
- **Neighbor-Aware Matching**: Considers similarity relationships with adjacent tiles
- **Dynamic Distance Modification**: Balances feature similarity with spatial constraints

### Robust Dataset Handling
- **Automatic CIFAR-10 Loading**: Fetches dataset via OpenML with balanced class sampling
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Synthetic image generation if dataset loading fails
- **Scalable Sample Size**: Adaptive sampling based on grid requirements
- **Memory Efficient**: Processes large datasets without memory overflow

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture
- **Grid-based Tiling**: Configurable grid sizes (default: 64x64)
- **Tile Resolution**: Adjustable tile size (default: 32x32 pixels)
- **Feature Vector**: 45-dimensional feature space per image
- **Distance Metric**: Euclidean distance in normalized feature space

### Performance Metrics
- **Assignment Cost**: Cumulative feature distance across all tile assignments
- **Uniqueness Ratio**: Percentage of unique images used vs total tiles
- **Mean Squared Error**: Pixel-level difference between target and mosaic
- **Processing Time**: Per-tile assignment timing for performance analysis
